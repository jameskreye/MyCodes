# MyCodes
I am a Software developer at Sentra Software House 
I work as an OSB (Oracle Service Bus) developer making soap and rest service middleware for Banking Companies, TelCo Companies and more.
I love to learn new stuff , I  am into front-end and back-end , I learn a bit of everything I find, because I am always curious about coding,
always want to learn more. and this is why I decided to upload projects I work on.
